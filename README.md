# Sr. Data Scientist Technical Exercise

This exercise simulates a typical situation you’ll face in your job at Apollo. It’s part of your interview and you’ll be evaluated on:

- approach towards solving the business problem
- exploratory data analysis
- feature engineering/selection - candidate should use advanced level of FE & FS techniques:
  - PCA
  - Anova/Chi
- model development – candidate should use advanced/complex ML algorithms and concepts and compare the performance:
  - XG Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
  - ADA Boost (Adaptive Boosting)
  - ANN using keras/tensorflow/pytorch
  - K-Fold Cross Validation
- correct performance metrics
- overall findings
- presentation & communication to technical & non-technical stakeholders
- 
The code you write to build your model should be in PYTHON.

Your thought process and work need to be summarised in a Power Point presentation lasting no more than 15 mins. This is intended to be a technical presentation. Think of it as an end-of-project review with your line manager and other technical experts. In addition to the technical slides, include one or two extra ones summarising your findings & recommendations as you would communicate with non-technical stakeholders.

## Problem Briefing
You are given access to a dataset containing information about Rubber Mixers. Your job is:
1. To build a model capable of predicting the efficiency of a mixer.
Mixer Efficiency = total_weight/mixing_time
2. To identify the features which will have maximum impact on the mixingcycletime.
3. To predict the mixer efficiency for the given set of data using advanced ML algorithms and compare the results.
